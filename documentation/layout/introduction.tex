\section{Introduction}
This report is a part of cluster and cloud computing module. We were provided with 4 instances, 36GB RAM, and 250GB data volumes over cloud. The requirement was to design a system from scratch to perform the following activities:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Set up VM on cloud using Ansible
	\item Set up Volumes and mount on individual nodes using Ansible
	\item Set up Couchdb on each node using Ansible
	\item Create Twitter harvestor and collect data in Couchdb
	\item Set up Docker to execute the Twitter harvester on each node
	\item Create logic to perform analysis on Twitter data
	\item Create front-end and set it up on independent Docker
	\item Cross reference the Twitter analysis with the AURIN data
\end{itemize}
