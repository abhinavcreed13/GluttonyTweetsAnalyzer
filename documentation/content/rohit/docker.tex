\subsection{Docker} \label{docker}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
Docker containers wrap up the software along with its dependencies in to one standardized unit. This can be used to  build and deploy new application with any dependencies on the operating system. This assures that application created from same docker file and dependencies will return the same output irrespective of system on which it runs. 
\subsubsection{Application and Code}
We have docker to deploy tweeter harvesters and User interface application. We are running these two using two different docker files.(Code for the Harvester [\ref{docker_code_1}] and code for UI App [\ref{docker_code_2}])
