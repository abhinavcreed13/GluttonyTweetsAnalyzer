\textbf{\texttt{Rohit.} }
My role in the team was to manage everything related to Docker i.e., analysis, setup, coding, deployment and testing. I have also worked on analysis of CouchDB using Map-Reduce. I worked on the initial drafting of backbone structure for the report using \LaTeX. I had explored Ansible and CouchDB locally in case we needed more resources. I also did some analysis on data and visualization.
