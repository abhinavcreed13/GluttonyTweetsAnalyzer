\textbf{\texttt{Jan.}}
My main role was together with Kabir to analyse the tweets and come up with a story. I worked in a branch called {\it knezi-analyse}. The described process is in the \autoref{chap:anal}. I created the tools for easier data manipulation - namely downloading tweets offline, creating views and filtering tools. Besides that I tried to find a correlation between some AURIN dataset and tweets I analysed. The effort I put into it was not directly visible, because many attempts have been abandoned, because they did not work.
