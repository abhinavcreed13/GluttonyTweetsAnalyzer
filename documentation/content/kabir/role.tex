\textbf{\texttt{Kabir.} }
My role was to predominantly work with twitter analysis and verify a story using AURIN. I along with Jan were working for the analysis. I began with working on text and tried to verify a story of people feeling unsafe to work in areas where there are a lot of tweets representing wrath, However, I wasn't able to get a lot of tweets during classification to verify my story. So, Jan and I wanted to try solving this my analyzing the corpus. I soon realized that, targeting gluttony may work best after going through our collected tweets. I was then able to get correlation with health diseases where people constantly talk about gluttony.
