\textbf{\texttt{Abhinav.} }
My role was to handle architecture and infrastructure related scenarios. I worked on the deployment section of the project - created \texttt{Ansible} packages with roles to deploy all required components of the application. This task was achieved using single executable script as explained in the Section \ref{deployment}. I worked on the application UI with Ben and designed \texttt{explore} section which helps us in explaining our story using pie-chart, scatter-plot and bar-chart. I have also intergrated different components of this project created by other teammates for full-functioning of the application.
