\textbf{\texttt{Ben.}}
My role was to design, develop, and refine the tweet harvester along with the mapping and data visualisation UI components. I collaborated with Rohit and Abhinav to add automated deployment of the tweet harvester, Jan and Kabir to integrate tweet analysis directly into the harvester, and with Abhinav to develop the UI.
